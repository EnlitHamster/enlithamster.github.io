# Enlit(Hamster | Owl)

Hello there! Name's Sandro Massa, and I'm a Software Developer @ CodeGrade BV, in Amsterdam. Sciences are my interest, but Computer Sciences is what I am really passionate about. So much so, that this small portfolio contains a rundown of what I have done, although mostly incomplete stuff.

To be honest, really, right now the website is under construction, I'll update it as soon as I think there is something worthwhile to put on it. Stay tuned cuz there are some interesting projects I'm working on. Please, take a look around my repositories if you want to have more info.
